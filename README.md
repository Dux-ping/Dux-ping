### 🚀 Education & Training

I have successfully completed immersive development programmes through [The Developer Academy](https://www.thedeveloperacademy.com) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), specialising in Front-End Development. These experiences gave me a solid foundation in modern web technologies and a passion for building user-centric applications.
